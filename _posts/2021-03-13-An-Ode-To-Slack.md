I like using `Slack` a lot at work and school. It's been a few years now that it came along and since then my love for slack has been growing, so much so, that a short while ago, I also wrote a poem to express my admiration for it. Today, I would like to share that poem with everyone, Enjoy!  

<h1 id="An Ode To Slack!">An ode to Slack!</h1>

It’s been a little over 3 years now..<br/>
I fell in love with this app..<br/>
We all know what it is..<br/>
and It couldn’t have been named better than “Slack”.

Everyday when I get to work..<br/>
Make my coffee and reach my desk..<br/>
You are more than anything else I want to check.

Besides collaborating and getting things done..<br/>
The beloved “Canlab-riverside” channel is there..<br/>
To make sure I don’t miss all the fun.

With every announcement made in a channel..<br/>
You do such a great job of spreading the word around..<br/>
Your ability to let me progress at work while communicating..<br/>
Has always left me spell bound.

Every now and then, there is so much to keep in mind..<br/>
The kind gesture of yours allowing me to pin items in a channel..<br/>
will never let me forget the foremost with tide of time.

You do get creative when following thy command /Giphy..<br/>
Every random GIF that you come up with, is **legend “wait for it” dary**…<br/>

Whenever I see a response in a thread..<br/>
And I want to get funny, sarcastic or quirky..<br/>
For any of those feelings there..<br/>
I know you will always have the right emoji!

You are one of those tools..<br/>
Which adds to an IBMers SWAG..<br/>
I would like to take this opportunity..<br/>
to thank you on behalf of the IBM Software lab.
