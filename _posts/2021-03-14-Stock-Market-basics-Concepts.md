I started my investment journey last year i.e 2020 and have learnt quite a few things about stock market. I would like to share some of my knowledge about investing with everyone, which will particularly be helpful for the beginners. 

<blockquote>Basically, I have put together a list of 7 key terms that you may hear often when people talk about stock market and investing. If youâ€™re a DIY investor, and just starting then chances are, you may not be familiar with these terms. But sooner or later you will come across them when you  do your research and invest. So, I am gonna try and explain these terms in simple terms so it can be helpful to you. So, lets get started, and Happy Investing! </blockquote>

<h1 id="Stock">1. Stock</h1>

Stock is a pretty much the most basic term in stock market investing also known as a share in a
company. It is a type of financial security that grants the holder of that stock a proportional ownership in the company.

For example, if theoretically Apple computers, a public company had 10 available shares to purchase and you
owned two of the 10 shares then you would have 20% ownership and therefore 20% voting power in that company.
Now, public companies though that are traded on exchanges will typically have hundreds of thousands if not
millions of issued shares to the public and therefore your relative proportion, if you own let's say a hundred shares an
Apple, is going to be reflected proportionally to the amount of shares that you own based on the amount of issued shares in the market.

<blockquote>So next time you're waiting in line at Starbucks and you see those teenagers in the corner talking about the fact that
they bought some stock in Tesla now you'll know what the heck they're talking about.</blockquote>


<h1 id="Bond">2. Bond</h1>

Next up on the list is most likely a term you've heard about in and around investment talk and that is
the bond. A bond is different from a stock. When you invest in Bonds, you're not purchasing and holding equity in a company and
therefore reaping rewards of dividends as well as stock value growth but instead you're lending out your funds
and getting interest payments in return and typically the borrower's are going to be a governmental entity or a private
company so the entity in need of the funds in this case the borrower is going to be the one that's gonna set the
characteristics for the loan, things such as the interest rate of the loan that need to be paid to the lenders as well
as the time and date at which the loan must be paid back, which is known as the maturity date of the bond. 

<blockquote>Now, there's a lot more that we could dive into relative to how bond interest rates are calculated as well as why bonds
typically do better when equity markets are taking a beating but for length of this post, I am gonna keep it to the basics.</blockquote>

<h1 id="ETF">3. ETF</h1>

All right moving on to the next term in today's list, is an exchange-traded fund or ETF.
ETF is basically a basket of various financial securities ranging from stocks bonds real estate gold and commodities and
other financial securities which seeks to track a specific index or market and they're traded on an exchange such as a
common stock this means that the share price of an ETF fluctuates throughout the day as its traded on an exchange and
by purchasing one share of an ETF you're instantly diversifying your holdings because you're gonna be holding a
portion of every single holding within that ETF. 

There's a bunch of different ETFs that you can choose from that each have a different goals in mind and that
seek to track different indexes and markets, for example the ETF vfv is an ETF that seeks to track their
the S&P 500 ,whereas the ETF hxq is one that seeks to track in the Nasdaq 100. 

<h1 id="Mutual Funds">4. Mutual Funds</h1>

Now following the ETF, you might be thinking to yourself that this sounds pretty similar to another financial
product known as the mutual fund, and to be honest they do have some similarities. Notably the fact that they hold multiple
financial securities within them. However, they also have some differences that I am gonna cover right now. In its
essence, a mutual fund is basically a large pool of money collected by separate investors that's used to deploy
into the market by purchasing stocks, bonds and other financial securities based on a specific investment goal. 

Unlike ETF, that are traded throughout the day on exchanges, a mutual fund is traded only once a day after the
markets closed. The mutual fund has a specific investment objective and goal in mind and the money in the fund is
managed professionally by portfolio managers who try to actively beat the market and have greater returns for the
investors in the fund. 

Personally though, I'm not a huge fan of mutual funds because having the money within a pool
managed by professional portfolio managers comes with higher expenses and fees and therefore dig into the returns
of an investor. On the other hand,  an ETF does not have people actively managing the funds instead the fund just tries to
replicate an index or market and therefore there's less overhead costs and those savings on fees are brought back into the pocket of the investors. 

If you do end up purchasing mutual funds though the value of each one of your shares is going to be dependent on the
actual returns of the different financial securities within the mutual fund just like an ETF basically.


<h1 id="REIT">5. REIT</h1>

Let's now move on to another term, called REIT which is a short form for real estate investment trust. In its essence a real
estate investment trust or REIT is a company that owns and operates real estate and gets its revenues from rental
income. Just like ETFs that can range greatly in turn of their objective and which financial securities are held within them, real
estate investment trusts are companies that can invest in different types of real estate and this can take a bunch of
different forms such as residential properties or buildings commercial properties retail space hospitals in a bunch of different types of property. A real estate investment trusts therefore transforms a real estate investing which is traditionally a more physical and hands-on type of investing into a tradable asset on an exchange that you can buy and sell straight from your smartphone. One of the reasons why

REITs are so attractive to dividend investors, because to qualify as a REIT a company needs to follow certain guidelines. One of them being that at a minimum the company needs to return 90 percent or more of the net income from a calendar year back to its
shareholders. This is one of the factors contributing to high dividend yields that we see in REITs.

<h1 id="Market Capitalization">6. Market Capitalization </h1>

Next term that I want to cover is less of a general concept like a stock or an ETF for example but it's more of a technical indicator for the market value of a company. I'm referring here to the market capitalization of a stock or market cap, which is a
quick indicator or quick snapshot of the market value of a company at that given time.

Simply put the market cap of a company is the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the current value of one share. Now, how does the market cap of a company have an impact on retail investors such as you and me, well although there isn't
a direct correlation between size of a company, growth and strategy of a company but technically speaking, if a company has a
market cap exceeding ten billion dollars they're more than likely gonna be an established company that has recurring
steady revenue and therefore can pay out dividends to their investors or shareholders. 

However if a company has let's say two billion dollars or less and market cap most likely this is going to be a company that's still looking to grow and expand. Therefore reinvesting all during that income into growth of the company and they're not gonna have any money left over to pay out as dividend to investors. 

<h1 id="Dividend">7. Dividend </h1>

Next term I am gonna be covering in this blog post is dividend. A dividend, if we want to be really simple, is basically just a reward that a company pays out to its investors in return for holding shares of the company. Dividends are paid out to investors typically when a company has matured and therefore has a steady recurring net income and can afford to pay out a proportion of its net income to shareholders. 

Paying out dividends to shareholders though really isn't an obligation and companies can choose to do so whichever way they want based on their overall strategy let's look at a
 
 
 <h1 id="Summary">Summary</h1>
 
I hope, this post gave you a better understanding of some of the basic terminology for stock market investing. In part two of this blog, I will be going over more technical stuff such as for example earnings per share price to book ratio price, their earnings ratio and a bunch of other things. Thanks a lot for reading this far!
