The 2020 pandemic shook up the business world in a way that we have never seen before and it is going to change the way that we do business forever into the future and that's what I'm going to be talking about today. 

<h1 id="Post pandemic office life" >A look into post pandemic office life</h1>

Office life is never going to be the same and that's kind of a fitting topic. The office life and business market is going to change and it is changing very quickly. I think the most obvious thing is that most companies especially digital companies are going to follow a virtual first model where people and employees don't have to come into the office every single day.  

<blockquote>People are not going to have an assigned desk it's going to be more of a shared open office space where people can come in a couple times a week or three times a week and then they can work from home or wherever they want the other times but an office would be kind of like a cool place to come hang out and work when you feel like it so you can work on your own time on your own schedule from wherever you want. </blockquote>

On the flip side, people are fleeing away from downtown because the rents are so expensive there and people buying homes in the suburbs with the office inside of the home that way they could work from home, and then they can go to the city whenever they want and this is starting to change the way businesses operate. Like before businesses would work to get an office space in a prime time location so they could attract the highest talent because if you had an office at the top floor with amazing views people wanted to work there.
But nowadays people don't really want to go into the office every single day they want to be able to work from home, that's especially true for high-tech firms. 
Like, if you are a business and people don't have to live within 30 minutes of your office anymore and now they're living in the suburbs and they're working from home why do you need to be located in an area where you have to pay super high taxes when people aren't even living there anymore ?

When people don't have to work in the office, they can work from wherever they want in the world. They can just go to a different province or a different city where they pay less in taxes and get to keep so much more money for themselves and not pay this money in taxes. Due to this big shift in how business is done and how companies are gonna be operating in the future, there's going to be so much more to how a business decides on where to operate and how to operate and it's going to go beyond just the borders of a city or a province or even a country. 

We're starting to near the end of this pandemic but this shift in the office culture and the business culture is just getting started over the next decade. You are going to see a major shift in the way businesses run and the way these cities operate. I think a lot of these landlords and a lot of these business owners are going to be in for a surprise because I don't think, immediately business owners are just going to rush back to the city. For one, this pandemic isn't just going to end and for two even when this pandemic ends things are not going to go back to normal the way they were before because people have become accustomed to this lifestyle and a lot of people kind of like this hybrid lifestyle they want to have a life where you can go to work when you want in the office and be able to work from your home whenever you want or be able to work from anywhere in the world because you can do your work from a laptop, why do you have to sit at a certain desk from nine to five ?

Now don't get me wrong there is value in working from office locations but what is the price of the value ? How much is it really worth ? and this is what businesses are gonna have to decide. This is going to be the changing the environment of our economy and a job market especially over the next decade like between 2021 and 2030. You are going to see a big shift in the office environment and the business environment and this is going to be on all levels like from the employee level from higher trained and what kind of jobs you have and how you're paid and where you can work and where you can live to the business level to how your office looks how businesses operate where your business is located.
